# Core Selenium Boilerplate Project (Python)

> **_NOTE:_** This is a work in progress (WIP).

The repository contains a boilerplate project for a core Selenium framework with Python. "Core" would mean that the project supports the most fundamental 
parts of a UI framework with Selenium:
* cross-browser support;
* elements support;
* base page support.

TODO: Add the rest of the readme content.
